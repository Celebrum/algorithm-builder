# Introduction to LDH and Nanofluids

## Layered Double Hydroxide (LDH)

LDH, also known as hydrotalcite, is a positively charged layered material with brucite-type sheets containing anionic counter ions and solvent molecules in the interlayer space.

## Nanofluids

Nanofluids are colloidal solutions of nanoparticles dispersed in a base fluid to enhance thermal performance. These fluids offer a promising approach to improving heat transfer efficiency in various applications.
