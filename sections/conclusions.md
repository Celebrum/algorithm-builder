# Conclusions and Future Work

## Key Findings
- Successful synthesis of Cuâ€“Al LDH nanoparticles (< 10 nm)
- Stability confirmed through zeta potential (+50 to +57 mV)
- Maximum thermal conductivity enhancement: 16.1% at 0.80 vol%
- Surface inactive nature compared to conventional surfactants

## Future Directions
- Investigation of concentration and shape effects
- Application-specific testing (jet/spray cooling)
- Long-term stability analysis
